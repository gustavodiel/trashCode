A bunch 'o trashy code I made during my free time. It includes some usefull stuff, like sockets and what not, but also contains pure garbage, such as some random string codes I made in Lua

One day, I might as well comment the code and/or organize it. I dont know. Maybe if I fell like and I have the time

From time to time, I will add some random code in here, just for the sake of keeping this active :D
